# Lab - Literature Review

Lab exercises to help you master the subject material and to complement the lecture material for Introduction to Interaction Design (F27DX).

# Overview

Your goal for this lab is to find three relevant research articles to your coursework 2 project. Possible domains of research include Interaction Design (IxD), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and User eXperience (UX).
	* These articles will support your ideas and help you state problems you're trying to solve - which is important!  Hence, the choice of keywords is critical.
	* Again you will not find articles which simply state the same idea


If you need to, review the lecture slides on what makes a credible article.
* Wikipedia and generally most online websites are not academic, while
* Academic conference papers and journal articles (usually peer reviewed) are reliable sources.
* Other possible criteria include:
    - Authority: what are the authors credentials? What type of site? Is the content peer reviewed? Who else cites the work? How many times?
    - Accuracy: are the facts verifiable? References included?
    - Objectivity: is it fact, opinion or propaganda?
    - (Out)datedness: Are the findings recent/up-to-date? Is the date indicated?

# How can I find/retrieve literature?

* This lab focuses on <a href='https://scholar.google.com'>Google Scholar [link]</a>.
    - Keywords are important, consider using advanced scholar once you know which keywords are relevant
    - Google Scholar directly tells you how many times the work has been cited elsewhere
    - Google Scholar provide automatically generated examples of formated references, these are not always correct/complete!

# Exercise 1

* Use Google Scholar to locate five to seven articles that seem relevant to a project of your choosing (focus on themes, articles which describe the problem, general ideas, etc – you will not find articles that discuss your exact solution)
* You should be able to directly access PDF’s, otherwise login to the Library

----

Examples of HCI venues/conferences
* Premier HCI conference: CHI (conference on Human factors in computing systems)
* INTERACT, British HCI, NordiCHI, Mobile HCI (for mobile computing)
* IDC (Interaction design for children)
* HRI (Human Robot Interaction conference), ASSETS (Designing for the disabled, accessibility)

Examples of HCI Journals
* ACM Interactions
* ACM Transactions on HCI
* Journal of Human Computer Studies
* Top Venues in HCI: https://scholar.google.es/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_humancomputerinteraction


# Exercise 2

* Initially skim through the (1) abstracts, (2) conclusions and (3) introduction. If a paper seems irrelevant after all, skip to another paper.
* Make notes on the content of the identified papers, try to identify the main theme or 'take home message' of the articles
* Attempt to group them under different categories (which will be their themes) by their similarities and differences - We are now in the first stages of writing a literature review.
* Select the 3 most relevant papers, that are not too similar to each other. Skim through the entire text of these three articles:
    - Add any additional notes, quotes, thoughts.
    - Make sure to relate your notes back to your own project. Think about (theoretical) background, substantiate any claims or assumptions you want to adopt (or make based on findings from one or more papers).

# Exercise 3

* Benchmarking your Proposed Design
* How do you benchmark your project against existing commercial software products?
* Identify at least one application that is relevant to your proposed idea (if you are improving upon an existing product, use that).
    - Explore this application.
    - Clearly identify how you intend to improve upon any flaws you find (what key features are missing that you intend to add in your design?)
* Examine the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
    - Describe at least three shortcomings of the GUI, relate back to Norman's design principles!
