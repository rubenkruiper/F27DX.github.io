# Lab - Usability and User testing

Lab exercises help you master the subject material and complement the lecture material for Introduction to Interaction Design (F27DX).

## Overview


* Deploy low- to medium-fidelity prototypes in usertests.
* Practice describing your evaluation methodology.
* Evaluate the usability and UX of your conceptual solutions.

# Activity 1 - Number of participants

* Read the following article ‘Why You Only Need to Test with 5 Users’.
Here: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/
* Briefly summarise the article in your own words, clearly stating why Nielsen comes to the conclusion that you only need 5 users for testing. Also, describe why one user is not enough and the conditions where you might need more than 5 users.


# Activity 2 – Questionnaire

One of the methods to inform the measurements in an evaluation of a user interface is the use of the questionnaire. Therefore, in this activity, you are needed to create a questionnaire.
* Please view the example of a usability test questionnaire from:
* https://it.toolbox.com/blogs/craigborysowich/sample-application-usability-test-questionnaire-072407

* Create a questionnaire (pay attention to how you frame questions!) on surveymonkey (require creating a free account):
* https://www.surveymonkey.com/

# Activity 3 - Evaluation methodology

As a part of Coursework 2, you will be submitting a report on your evaluation methodology for the UI you have developed.
Have a look at the possible evaluation template described in lecture 8, one of the last slides.
Please attempt to follow this template in the evaluation methodology for coursework 2.
For the following situations describe an appropriate evaluation methodology (in each situation identify, the method/technique that is proposed to be used, procedure, materials, setup, measurements, participants).:
* Situation 1: You are evaluating a prototype for theater booking system to be used by potential theatre-goers to reduce queues at the box office.
* Situation 2: You have designed and implemented a new interaction style for a game and would like to evaluate it.
* Situation 3: Now think about a possible evaluation methodology for your project for Coursework 2!
