# Lab - Introduction

Lab exercises help you master the subject material and complement the lecture material for Introduction to Interaction Design (F27ID).

## Overview

* Every week has a set of exercises/labs for you to work on
* Maintain your answers in a workbook (online or word document)
* Each exercise will help you with your coursework and/or revision
* Do not worry if you are unable to finish the exercises, but attempt all the exercises


# Activities Planned for Lab 1

* Norman’s design principles
* Culture and HCI
* Preparation for Project Assessments
* Please initiate your tutorial workbooks online



# Norman’s Design Principles – following from Lecture 1

* Visibility
* Affordance
* Constraints
* Mapping
* Consistency
* Feedback
* Cultural Assumption


# Exercise 1

* Explore the website http://baddesigns.com/examples.html
* Choose 1 example from each of the categories and also provide justification for the choice,
   - Things, Displays, Controls, Signs
* For each example, reflect on each of the Norman’s design principles
   - Describe which principles are violated and why giving clear explanations.
* Record your notes in your workbook


# Exercise 2

* Everyone read Don Norman’s article <a href="https://jnd.org/does_culture_matter_for_product_design/">Link</a>
* As a group, briefly review and discuss the importance of culture as a variable to consider when designing interfaces
* What are Don Norman's main view points as to why he thinks culture’s influence on HCI may not be as important as we think?
* Do you agree with his views? Would his arguments (which are mainly intended for physical products) also apply to software/GUIs/etc?


# Exercise 3

* Please investigate the products/software developed at your company
   - Do you see any interactions/interfaces that violate any of the mentioned Norman’s design principles?
   - Describe which principles are violated and why giving clear explanations.
   - Can you think of specific users for which problems might arise during interaction?
   - Can you think of additional functionalities that users might desire?
   - Record your answers in your workbook
