# Lab - Problem Space

Lab exercises help you master the subject material and complement the lecture material for Introduction to Interaction Design (F27ID).


# Activities Planned for Lab 2

* You will come up with your project ideas:
    - Work individually on an IxD project, throughout the lab sessions
    - Choose a problem space
    - Plenary discussions of the research problem/design statement you will work on


* Tips: Look at current solutions! Try to identify problems, or perhaps think of new functionalities/products.

* Answer all questions briefly in your workbook!


# Exercise 1 -- Problem Finding
* Choose a problem space, describe as much as you know
* Look for the inefficiencies with an interface or specific interactions
* Who is having this problem? When do they have this problem? Why is it a problem?
When does it become a problem?

# Exercise 2 -- Defining your problem (in the real/current situation)

* Real
    - What is the current state of the system, how does it operate in reality today?
* Ideal
    - What could the desired system be? What are the Desirable  products and activities
    - What is the possible solution, or the characteristics of a solution?


# Exercise 2A. Real v Ideal: A step towards formulating your project idea
* Describe a real-life situation where there are flaws/problems and where an interface/mobile app can help.
* Consider alternative, existing solutions (even if not ideal).
* Describe the real and ideal situation/scenario/context.



# Exercise 3: Design Statement

* From your chosen project idea, move towards finalizing its design statement
* Design statement is a one line sentence that describes your project (and answers the who, what, where, why etc)
* Our goal is to design a “____ (what)” for “____ (who)” that provides a “___ (why)” and enhances “___(why)” while in a “____ (where)”
* Discuss your design statement with your tutor and clearly outline in your document (google drive, word doc)
* What is your idea? Use Bill Verplank's framework to sketch out a conceptual model.
